\f0\fs20 \cf0 Instead of saying he thought to draw his weapon, he DREW his weapon. He needs to make it an active choice or it\'92s telling.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Again, pistols aren\'92t usually formal party attire. He might have one hidden somewhere, but unlikely to be on his belt (somewhere).}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 2 things. 1, this could be reworded much better, and 2, you need to make sure we know which gun is where\'85so..\
\'93When Jonathan was standing, the killer leaned over and picked up his discarded pistol, careful to keep his own gun trained on Jonathan\'92s forehead. He stuffed the gun into his belt, and asked him, \'91What are you doing here?\'92\'94}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 A skirt-chaser and a drinker? Opium was also popular in Victorian times. If you\'92re going to give characters vices, that\'92s great! But you need to make it a part of them, and there should be a reason why they do things, just like real people. You touched on it briefly with Jonathan\'92s backstory w/his father, but might want to expand on that somewhere to make it more real.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 You could just write the curse word into the dialogue and avoid this first sentence. Damn, shit, or something invented would be nice.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 I think this isn\'92t a good enough excuse, really. Many of the aristocracy would be sport hunters, so unless they don\'92t do that in your world (which you\'92d have to make a point of saying earlier on) or they all have terrible hearing, at least a few other people would have heard it. ESPECIALLY those men smoking on the balcony. This needs to be fixed. Either he needs to have super keen hearing, was the only one near the stairs/balcony, or something else inventive. Maybe he has a mechanical earpiece to enhance his own hearing, implanted in his eardrum??

\f0\fs20 \cf0 He didn\'92t actually see it happen\'85 in theory, he heard it, but she could have been shooting in the air for all he knows. \

\f0\fs20 \cf0 I don\'92t know why you killed him, but I wanted to. OR, I would have done the same, etc. \

He can\'92t \'91would like to\'92 kill someone that\'92s already dead.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Is this is any way related to the Solomon Grundy nursery rhyme, or just a coincidence? If just a coincidence and her fake name is not important, you might consider changing it, though perhaps not very many people will make that connection?}]]></Comment>
