\f0\fs20 \cf0 I think this might be a more appropriate beginning for your story. It introduces your Main POV in an interesting way, to hook the reader.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 If it is in reference to the nursery rhyme, then is this party on Saturday? Should well informed readers expect this character to turn up dead??? Because that would be awesome.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 You use in fact, actually, etc. many times when, in fact, you don\'92t really need to use it at all. It just clutters up the writing and doesn\'92t add anything to the scene Disregard for dialogue, of course.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Jonathon\'92s office, or his father\'92s office was full of his father\'92s belongings? Probably his father\'92s, and he needed to clean that out before he could take ownership of the room.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Because you\'92re talking about the more distant past, I\'92d suggest using he had written instead of he wrote, like you used \'91he\'92d looked up to\'92 in the previous sentence.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Instead of continuing to fight, maybe something saying he wanted to avoid the risk of losing what little affection his father might have for him. \'93Jonathan turned his back on the family business rather than risk losing what little was left of his father\'92s regard.\'94 This is a more active sentence.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Is this important right now? Find a way to show it instead of telling. Maybe he was bequeathed something special on the father\'92s death & Jonathan has to give it to him?? I would cut this line out.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 This whole paragraph can be rewritten as a short scene that explains all these things with dialogue, which would be much better than telling us all this info. You would need to move it somewhere else,  perhaps.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 This entire section could be made into a separate scene, or even two. You have it plunked down in the middle of important action, and while it IS important as well, it isn\'92t really the best place to go on a tangent.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 I would move all this up to right after he puts his hand in his pocket to feel the note. Makes it more immediate, and relevant. The stuff in between can go somewhere else.  Add a line that connects the two sections and BOOM. Awesomesauce.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 I think that to make him more believable as a womanizer or skirt chaser type, you need to put at least one instance of it happening BEFORE he doesn\'92t do it here. Or at least he should flirt with her while they\'92re dancing and wink, regretfully, as he walks away. Something. Otherwise, it really just doesn\'92t seem to fit his character thus far.}]]></Comment>
