\f0\fs20 \cf0 They are intelligent enough to climb the ladder? Then they should be able to do all kinds of things. This might present a believability problem.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Why leave this so late in the story for the reader? Sure, the other characters don\'92t need to know, but this information the reader should have much earlier.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 All of these are noisemakers, which someone would have noticed before now.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Pretty but somewhat disfigured is a bit of a clich\'e9. The arm doesn\'92t count, since no one (including the reader) knew about it until now, and her facial scar isn\'92t that disfiguring. Perhaps if she made more of a big deal about being ashamed of it. But, she gets along just fine, she\'92s a kick ass thief and can take care of herself. Using this disfigurement thing here is no Bueno.}]]></Comment>
