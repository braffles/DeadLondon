\f0\fs20 \cf0 This type of description makes it seem as though she\'92s \'91checking him out.\'92 You might reword it a bit to be less romancy. Or even just leave this part out. Most people will assume he\'92s taller, as a man, so unless he\'92s a very small guy you might not need to mention this here.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 This safe is a great opportunity for MOAR steampunk. It was disguised as a tea tray, perhaps that can be incorporated in how it opens? Maybe lifting the teapot lid does something, and there are gears and cranks, etc.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs20 \cf0 Not necessary to tell us this. We know due to you showing us! \
\
Also, they BOTH have crazy good hearing? Wouldn\'92t Jonathan have heard the click too since his hearing is so amazing? I think her proximity to the safe might have more to do with it, OR you can give her a cool listening device.

\f0\fs20 \cf0 So there is romance to be had\'85I\'92m definitely ok with that, but I don\'92t think now is the time for her to be noticing his eyes.
