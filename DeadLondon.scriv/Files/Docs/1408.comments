\f0\fs20 \cf0 Here is another bit of romance thrown in\'85I just don\'92t think it fits in the story, unless you go back to the beginning and work on Jonathan\'92s character a bit. This story doesn\'92t NEED a romantic subplot, and most of the time it feels as though you are trying to force one in.}]]></Comment>
