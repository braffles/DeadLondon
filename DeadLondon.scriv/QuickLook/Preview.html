<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene i</strong><br/>Jonathan hastened to keep pace with his friends. They had slipped between a pair of tall trees and slid down the muddy slope that led down to the river. His governess had warned him not to stray too far from the house, but Jonathan had never felt particularly inclined to listen to her, especially when doing so might interfere with an adventure.<br/>
It was raining, so the slope was slick, but Jonathan could hear his friends’ voices ahead of him. He pushed off at the top of the hill and let his moment...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene ii</strong><br/>When he regained consciousness, there was a man with a bird’s face standing at the side of his bed. Behind him, a pale white boy with blonde hair, about his own age or perhaps a few years older, stood against the wall, looking shyly back. Jonathan offered up a weak smile, but the boy turned away from him, busying himself with his work. He had a jar of leeches in one hand and a doctor’s surgical bag in the other. He set the jar down on the table beside the man in the bird's face.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Chapter 1</strong><br/>Annabel arrives at Lord Connor’s party. Disguised as a gentleman, she makes her way unnoticed, to Lord Connor’s study, intending to rob his safe.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 1</strong><br/>Lord Henry Connor’s annual masquerade was reputed to be the grandest ball in all of London. The extravagance of the event could not possibly have been overstated, nor the number of attendants exaggerated.<br/>
The families who attended were notable and prominent in London politics and business, science and commerce. Aristocrats, foreign dignitaries, ministers, and scientists. The well-to-do. The sort of ladies whose choices of garments would make the morning Post. The sort of men who earned more in a...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 2</strong><br/>Annabel let out a cry of alarm. Annabel wasn't the screaming type, but she was on the verge. Her eyes were wide. Her heart was hammering, and she suddenly found that it was a struggle just to suck in a breath of air. Of course, it couldn’t have helped much that her breasts were bound in cloth as part of her disguise; she was wrapped up tighter than a pharaoh in his tomb, and every breath was painful.<br/>
She reminded herself that she’d been in spots tighter than this. She told herself to remain calm...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 3</strong><br/>As Jonathan Grimmer stepped down onto solid ground, heads turned. It was one thing to arrive in an upscale carriage, like so many of the other guests, or to show up dressed in the finest silks money could buy. It was another thing entirely to arrive by airship. Even among the ton, the Penny Dreadful drew attention. If Prince Albert himself had arrived at the party in a velocipede, he still would not have made such an impressive entrance. Which was precisely what Jonathan wanted. If he was to gai...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 4</strong><br/>The moment she heard the click of the latch, she reached for her mask, and with deft hands, covered her face with it.<br/>
When she returned her attention to the door, a gentleman stood there watching her. The expression on his face was one of shock.<br/>
“My god!” he exclaimed at last.<br/>
“It’s not what it looks like,” said Annabel, still attempting to free herself from beneath Connor.<br/>
It was a compromising enough situation, dressed as a man, lying on her back beneath the body of a man. Perhaps she could ca...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 5</strong><br/>Jonathan wasn’t easily shocked. From a young age, he’d been trying his hand at the family business, writing articles for his father’s papers. As a teenager, he’d often conduct research for his father’s stories, never quite taking it seriously but nonetheless often winding up in unusual situations in the name of journalism. He’d interviewed adulterers, men dressed as women, murderers, and hangmen. For a man of his profession, it was important to be able to remain calm and composed in any situatio...</p>

“You’re stealing from him?” said Mr. O. “That’s why you came here? What does he have in there that was worth killing for?”<br/>
Annabel shook her head.<br/>
“I don’t know,” she said. “I only know how much it’s worth. I have a buyer, and they’re willing to pay handsomely for whatever it is.”<br/>
“Can’t be anything good. Connor was a Resurrectionist,” said Mr. O.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Chapter 4</strong><br/>Jonathan escapes via airship, slightly rattled and now implicated in Connor’s death. He makes his way to Allen’s Street, hoping to gather information on the Resurrectionists in order to clear his name.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 7</strong><br/>The door closed behind Monday, leaving Jonathan with a sense of being trapped. He was alone, in the dark, with Lord Connor’s body. He hovered at the door for a moment. He nearly considered following Monday out of the room, but he quickly realized that wasn’t an option.<br/>
This wasn’t the first time Jonathan’s impulsiveness had gotten him into a sticky situation. He didn’t know what he would have done if Connor had been alive when he’d stormed into the room. He hadn’t thought that far ahead.<br/>
He felt...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 8</strong><br/>He looked out the window, down at the city below. He still felt that same tingling sensation in his nerves when looking out at this height. As he’d told Monday, he didn’t often travel by airship. If it could be helped, he’d have preferred just about any other method of transportation. Carriage, train, bicycle. Foot, even. He headed for the bar. A dash of absinthe and he’d feel right as rain.<br/>
He tapped a finger on the bar to get the barman’s attention, and gestured for the bottle. There was alway...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 9</strong><br/>Annabel slipped silently into the revolving ballroom, apparently still unnoticed despite the drama that had unfolded upstairs. The dance continued. The musicians still played, the ladies and gentlemen continued to waltz, or to stand on the sidelines and clap politely when the dance ended. But somehow the atmosphere had changed, subtly. At first, Annabel could not mark what that change was, but eventually she discovered what had set her on edge.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 10</strong><br/>“What was the meaning of that, do you think, Bailey? Comparing me to Sherlock Holmes, really!” Roderick Steen scoffed. “I cannot understand the comparison. Was the implication that I am an alcoholic? That I have a predilection for narcotics? Or was there an accusation of homosexual tendencies?”<br/>
Roderick was standing before a canvas, making long brushstrokes in light colours and occasionally pausing to gander at his subject. Rémy was handsome, fair of skin and hair, thin but tall. He was also nak...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 11</strong><br/>Without a suitable location to dock the Penny Dreadful, Jonathan had been forced to disembark via rope ladder, while the ship remained floating above. With a sense of vertigo made worse by a head dizzied by absinthe, he’d climbed down to the ground below. He’d signalled to the ship, then made his way on foot.<br/>
Distance, time, and drink had already managed to calm Jonathan’s nerves, and although he’d had a gun pointed at his head and jumped out the window to escape a gang of masked men, he was beg...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 12</strong><br/>Annabel stumbled onto the street, gasping for air. She didn’t know if she’d inhaled whatever vapours had been released into the air, but she might have. She had a strange taste in her mouth and the smell of death still lingered. She felt disoriented. She heard a rumbling sound from above and looked up to see Mr. O’s airship pulling away from the window. She felt a breath of relief to know that he’d made it out.<br/>
She took a moment to catch her breath while she gazed up at the airship. If she’d bee...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 13</strong><br/>Jonathan had grown tired of traveling by airship and had therefore given the ship’s captain and crew the rest of the night off. Captain Merrick had provided him with a flare gun, in case he needed to summon the ship after all.<br/>
With the flare gun tucked safely in his belt, and one of his father’s guns on the opposite hip, Jonathan flagged down a passing fly carriage. He gave the driver the address Roderick had printed neatly on the calling card. While not as quick as the airship, a fly was at lea...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 14</strong><br/>The ride to Lord Connor’s mansion was not long. Roderick arrived shortly, exited the cabriolet, and walked the rest of the way up the long drive to the mansion. He had attended last year’s masquerade, and so was familiar with the mansion.<br/>
He stepped inside and had to cover his mouth with a handkerchief to avoid gagging. He was unprepared for the overwhelming stench, and nearly lost his lunch. He’d been expecting just one dead body, Connor’s, but there were bodies littering the floor. Dozens of t...</p>

The room was supported by marble columns and decorated with ancient greek statues that looked like they belonged in a museum. Continuing along the lines of the theme of the rest of the house, the series of statues depicted Hades binding Persephone to the underworld, Persephone raising a piece of pomegranate to her lips while Hades looked on eagerly; Hades ...</p>

Of course, in London, he should have been constantly prepared for inclement weather. He scanned the sky for his ride home, but it was difficult to see in the rain and darkness. He thought he saw a light flickering from above, its light refracted by the falling raindrops and the mist rising off the cobbles. It might have been the Penny Dreadful’s lanterns, but he wasn’t sure. H...</p>

The sleet and fog blurred Jonathan’s vision. He couldn’t be entirely sure what he was seeing, but Sinews was a blur of motion, in one place one moment, in another the next. The policemen opened fire, the gunshots echoing along the empty street, but Sinews was too quick.<br/>

This was the famous London Particular the city was famous for. Jonathan could see crows circling across the sky, but their movement seemed unnatural somehow, almost mechanical.

The first half of the second act is where your characters find the time and space to react to the first major plot point. The first major plot point is going to hit your character hard. His life is no longer running on the same smooth path it always has, and he has to do something about it.

At least both her eyes were working. She might have expected to have had her prosthesis removed by her captors, so it was a relief that her vision was still entirely intact. She unstrapped the device, took the key from around...</p>
