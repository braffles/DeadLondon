If you want to beat a man in a fight, you need to hit him harder than he hits you. Or more often. Either that, or you need to hit him where it hurts most.<br/>

It was one thing to arrive in an upscale carriage—like so many of the other guests—or to show up dressed in the finest silks money could buy. It was another thing entirely to arrive by airship. Even among the ton, the Penny Dreadful drew attention. If Prince Albert himself had arrived at the party in an ornithopter, he still would not have made such an impressive entrance.

Annabel had worked her way into the upper echelons of society through hard work, perseverance, raw talent, and most importantly—cheating. Even her current identity was stolen; Annabel had dozens them, mostly claimed from dead rich folks with no surviving family members to dispute her identity. With no identity of her own, Annabel was a ghost. Procuring an invitation to the party should be as easy as...</p>

“We also publish penny dreadfuls,” Jonathan said with a grin, enjoying the wide-eyed expression on Grundy's face.. Meanwhile, Miss Karnstein’s eyes lit up.<br/>

She took note of the size of the room with its high, gilded ceilings, the huge Grecian statues which adorned the room, the numerous paintings upon the walls.

“Hear what?” Mircalla answered.<br/>
Jonathan shook his head, second-guessing himself. Perhaps it was just the clang of clockwork, a cog in the machine that rotated the ballroom.<br/>
“Never mind,” he said. “What room do you suppose that would be?” he added, pointing up in the direction the gunshot seemed to have come from.<br/>
Miss Karnstein paused to think for a moment.<br/>

Connor’s body went limp and landed, hard, against Annabel’s chest. She grimaced with distaste, but she was relieved it was over. She took a moment to try to wipe the blood from her face. The applause began to subside and eventually gave way to silence. In the quiet moments that followed the gunshot, she heard the click of a latch and the creak of hinges. Someone had opened the door.<br/>

From a young age, he’d been trying his hand at the family business, writing articles for his father’s papers. As a teenager, he’d often conduct research for his father’s stories, never quite taking it seriously but nonetheless often winding up in unusual situations in the name of journalism. He’d interviewed adulterers, men dressed as women, murderers, and hangmen. For a man of his profession, it was important to be able to remain calm and composed in any situatio...</p>

She needed to roll him onto his back to do so, and he was heavy. Damn heavy. She huffed with the effort as she heaved him over. His head rolled, giving her a clear view of the exit wound at the back of his skull.<br/>
She turned his head until he was looking at her. She almost recoiled. His face was a vision of horror.<br/>

Even if he managed to flee the room unseen, he’d made no secret of the fact that he was looking for Connor. Once the body was discovered, the police would start asking questions.

Carriage, train, bicycle. Foot, even. He headed for the bar. A dash of absinthe and he’d feel right as rain. <br/>

He thought he saw a light flickering from above, its light refracted by the falling raindrops and the mist rising off the cobbles.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Chapter Thirty-Four</strong><br/>Annabel stared hard at Abraham Palmer. Although she’d never trusted him for a second, she still felt betrayed. She realized it was because she was thinking of how Jonathan felt about Palmer. Jonathan had trusted Palmer with his life. He would be devastated when he learned of Palmer’s deceit.<br/>
“Kick the crossbow over here,” he said.<br/>
She did as she asked without arguing.<br/>
“And your other guns,” he said, gesturing meaningfully at the pistols in her belt.<br/>
She did as he asked. Tense silence followed, a...</p>

This was not Roderick’s first visit to the printing company’s library, but he’d never noticed a staircase in here before. Of course, that was the whole point of a secret staircase. It wouldn’t be in plain sight, he reasoned.<br/>
The library was one of the largest rooms in the company, and one of the most decadent in its decor. It had high ceilings to accommodate the tall ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Chapter Thirty-Five</strong><br/>Jonathan crept along the dimly lit hallway, the undulating tones of the siren reverberating throughout the facility. Their plan had already failed, if the Resurrectionists knew they were here. He could have killed Palmer for his betrayal. If Roderick or Annabel ended up hurt because of it, he really would.<br/>
He needed to hurry, though. Abandoning stealth, he raced down the hallway toward the laboratory. As he rounded the corner, the siren sound cut off, and Jonathan nearly ran straight into a pair...</p>

She returned her attention to Palmer, who was trying to get up. She kicked him in the back, and he grunted in pain. She looked again at Anthony Tidkins.<br/>
“Is it really too late?” she asked him, having to shout to be heard over the alarm.<br/>
“For us?” he asked.<br/>
Tidkins had taken off his mask, which he now held in one hand. His face was as familiar to h...</p>

His gun was aimed at the spot where Tidkins had been, and a cloud of smoke trailed from the muzzle. Roderick’s teeth were gritted, his eyes narrowed and fiercely focused on Tidkins’ body. He seemed to be blinking back tears.<br/>
“That was for Rémy,” he said.<br/>
Annabel’s knees threatened to buckle, and tears formed in her eye, but she managed to keep herself upright. She wanted to launch herself at Roderick and tear his throat out, though all he’d done wa...</p>

The scientists had deserted the room, Dr. Jekyll among them.<br/>
“How did they get out?” Annabel asked Palmer. “Your map didn’t indicate another way out of this lab.”<br/>
“I don’t know,” he said. “It’s possible the Resurrectionists made some additions to the facility without my knowledge.”<br/>
“Never mind that,” said Roderick. “They’re going to get in.”<br/>
“Give me my gun,” Palmer asked.<br/>
Annabel stared hard at him. The door shuddered again. The zombies were going to get in, and soon. They needed Palmer’s help...</p>

She wound her gears yet again, and gave her fingers an experimental turn. She clenched and unclenched her fist.<br/>
Satisfied, they headed back into the hall.<br/>
Roderick took up the rear, watching their backs while Jonathan took the lead. Annabel stood at his side, ready with a surgical knife in case they ran into zombies. For the most part, it seemed that the zombies had all been dealt with. ...</p>

She believed that Anthony always had valued every human life; he had always been a bit strange, a bit mad even, but it had been tough to swallow the idea that the plan to destroy the entire city had been his alone, except that it was to save his father.</p>

“I’m just pouring a cup of tea, Jonathan. Nothing to marvel at,” she told him.<br/>
He grinned.<br/>
“On the contrary, you are a constant marvel, my dear Annabel.”<br/>
