Connor’s head rolled, giving her a clear view of the exit wound at the back of his skull.<br/>

His life is no longer running on the same smooth path it always has, and he has to do something about it.

Annabel reacts to learning that Jack Bernhardt is Anthony Tidkins. She wants to find him, and she wants to get back what she stole from Connor’s safe.<br/>

He could try to climb through the window and climb down to the ground below, but it was a long way down if he fell. Or, like Jack Sheppard, he could chip a hole into the ceiling and climb through it. He sighed. Either way, it was going to be a long night.<br/>
Gripping the iron bar tightly, he applied himself to the task of putting a hole through the ceiling with furious energy. He didn’t wish to be left b...</p>

He'd always felt that a doctor aboard the ship was a ridiculous waste of money, but now that he knew the truth about his father, it made sense. He was still trying to come to terms with what Palmer had told him. Charles Grimmer wasn't just an illu...</p>

Roderick scooped up the excited terrier and kissed his brow affectionately. He allowed the dog to lick his face, laughing as the dog’s soft tongue tickled his cheeks. He ushered Annabel and Jonathan inside.<br/>
