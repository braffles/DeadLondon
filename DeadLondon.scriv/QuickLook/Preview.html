It was one thing to arrive in an upscale carriage—like so many of the other guests—or to show up dressed in the finest silks money could buy. It was another thing entirely to arrive by airship.

Connor’s head rolled, giving her a clear view of the exit wound at the back of his skull.<br/>

The first half of the second act is where your characters find the time and space to react to the first major plot point. The first major plot point is going to hit your character hard. His life is no longer running on the same smooth path it always has, and he has to do something about it. If we look long and hard at the first major turning point in a book, we realize that it’s actually the character’s reaction to the event that changes everything and creates our story.<br/>

Annabel reacts to learning that Jack Bernhardt is Anthony Tidkins. She wants to find him, and she wants to get back what she stole from Connor’s safe.<br/>

Jonathan reacts to the knowledge that the Resurrectionists may have killed his father and the knowledge that they have unleashed a zombie virus upon the city.<br/>
